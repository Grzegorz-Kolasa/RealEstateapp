# Real Estate Recommendation App

The **Real Estate Recommendation App** is a Python-based application that helps users find properties similar to their dream property. It uses machine learning models to generate embeddings for property descriptions and leverages OpenAI's language models to create personalized property descriptions based on user preferences.

## Features

- **User Input**: Collects user preferences for their dream property, including neighborhood, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, and descriptions.
- **Property Matching**: Finds similar properties from a database using embeddings generated by the `SentenceTransformer` model (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Personalized Descriptions**: Generates new property descriptions and neighborhood descriptions using OpenAI's GPT-based models, inspired by the user's dream property.
- **CSV Integration**: Reads and writes property listings to/from a CSV file for easy data management.
- **Database Storage**: Stores property data and embeddings in a LanceDB database for efficient querying.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating property and neighborhood descriptions.
- **SentenceTransformer**: For generating embeddings of property descriptions.
- **LanceDB**: For storing and querying property data.
- **pandas**: For handling tabular data.
- **dotenv**: For securely managing API keys and environment variables.
